Profile
As an enthusiastic and proactive individual, I always put my personal education as well as my employer's needs and perspectives first. I am pursuing a BSc Computer Science degree at Middlesex University in London. I recently was doing an exchange program in Melbourne, Australia. I have the capacity and confidence to cope with pressure and challenges; at the same time, I am also an effective team player and have the competence of working on my own initiative. I generate a positive attitude towards all my work and enjoy problem solving.
I possess very extensive life skills from the experiences I gain by living, working and studying in the UK and Australia. These experiences assisted me to develop key skills, such as; problem solving, critical thinking, responsible decision making, while applying them to my studies.
I am now looking for an internship opportunity in a dynamic organisation within the IT sector, where I could contribute toward the success of a company alongside expanding my skills and abilities.
